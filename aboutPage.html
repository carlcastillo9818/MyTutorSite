                <h3>My Tutoring Mission Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    My mission when it comes to tutoring is to help the student/learner to understand programming (or math) concepts
                    as clearly as possible.  I will achieve this through easy-to-understand examples, reference videos, live tutoring 
                    sessions, drawings, and even cooperative projects for more complex concepts! Whether its Python, C++, Java, or Algebra
                    then I'll be sure to help out as best as possible in the tutoring sessions and make it worth your while!
                </p>
