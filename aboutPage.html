                    <li>I am currently pursuing a Computer Science bachelors degree.</li>
                    <li>I like to code, play guitar, and play video games as well!</li>
                    <li>My favorite programming language currently is Python (simple to learn but hard to master!)</li>
                    <li>I've tutored a C++ computer science class in the Spring but I started helping students back in 2019 
                        at the IT computer lab in my CC in several programming languages as well as basic algebra to precalculus.</li>

                <h3>My Tutoring Mission Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    My mission when it comes to tutoring is to help the student/learner to understand programming (or math) concepts
                    as clearly as possible.  I will achieve this through easy-to-understand examples, reference videos, live tutoring 
                    sessions, drawings, and even cooperative projects for more complex concepts! Whether its Python, C++, Java, or Algebra
                    then I'll be sure to help out as best as possible in the tutoring sessions and make it worth your while!
                </p>
