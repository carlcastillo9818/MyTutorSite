                <p id = "myFirstProjectParagraph">This program is a game that plays like the popular game "Frogger" It involves the player (a frog) having to cross
                through several streets of traffic (cars) and some paths of grass. After surviving that, they have to cross through a
                river full of logs that are moving along the water. The frog can traverse using those logs and reach several caves which
                are the destination goals. Each cave rewards points and in addition there is a dragonfly that moves very fast but if it
                is caught by the frog then bonus points are rewarded. If the player loses all their lives, they can submit their score
                to the leaderboard and end the game or restart it. I used Python and the Pygame library to make this game, it was a very
                fun experience.</p>

                <p id = "mySecondProjectParagraph">This project was done using PostgreSQL and I had to create it for my last database course at my university. 
                It involved triggers, functions, procedures, and working with large datasets. The scenario is that there is
                a chain of DVD rental stores and the staff has trying to figure out which movie categories made the most money and the
                least money for the DVD rental store in each season of the year and how many rentals occurred for each category. They
                would like to know about things like total rental payment amounts for each category. The staff needs to figure out how
                many rentals occurred in each film category so they can order more copies of popular films or reduce stock of unpopular
                films in the DVD inventory.</p>

                <p id = "myThirdProjectParagraph">This application provides a directory from which the client can select customers, appointments, or reports to view. In
                addition, the app enables the client to add, modify, or delete any customers or appointments. There is extra filtering
                options to view appointments by current month or current week. The reports are divided into three different reports, one
                that shows appointments by any month or any type, one that shows the appointments of the trusted contacts, and a final
                one that shows how many customers the company has within divisions and countries. This application will allow the
                company to do all these operations efficiently and clearly and they can maintain their database of customers and
                appointments without worry of losing any of it when the application closes. This project uses the following application
                technologies: JavaFX, IntelliJ, MySQL, Scene Builder.</p>

                <p id = "myFourthProjectParagraph">This project was created in IntelliJ with JavaFX and Scenebuilder for my Java software development class.
                    It involves creating an inventory system for a fictional manufacturing organization. Instead of using a spreadsheet program,
                    this GUI application serves as the ideal program for managing inventory additions, deletions, and other data such as parts and products.
                    This project involved object oriented programming with various programming concepts such as observablelists, interfaces, inheritance, static 
                    variables, static methods, and GUI components such as buttons,labels,text fields, and more!
