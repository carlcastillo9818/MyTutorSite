                <p id = "myFirstProjectParagraph">This program is a game that plays like the popular game "Frogger" It involves the player (a frog) having to cross
                through several streets of traffic (cars) and some paths of grass. After surviving that, they have to cross through a
                river full of logs that are moving along the water. The frog can traverse using those logs and reach several caves which
                are the destination goals. Each cave rewards points and in addition there is a dragonfly that moves very fast but if it
                is caught by the frog then bonus points are rewarded. If the player loses all their lives, they can submit their score
                to the leaderboard and end the game or restart it. I used Python and the Pygame library to make this game, it was a very
                fun experience. </p>

                <p id = "mySecondProjectParagraph">This app acts like a MINI pokedex (showing water types, fire types, and anymore I choose to do). It uses standard views,
                images, labels, and a custom Pokemon class as well as passing data from view to view. The starting view presents
                different choices between pokemon types, a user clicks on one and that takes them to a new view which presents them with
                different Pokemon of that respective type. After a user clicks on one of the pokemon, a third view opens and this is the
                one that resembles the Pokedex, it shows a picture or gif of the Pokemon, their name, pokedex number and a description
                about them.</p>
