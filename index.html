                <p id = "myFirstProjectParagraph">This program is a game that plays like the popular game "Frogger" It involves the player (a frog) having to cross
                through several streets of traffic (cars) and some paths of grass. After surviving that, they have to cross through a
                river full of logs that are moving along the water. The frog can traverse using those logs and reach several caves which
                are the destination goals. Each cave rewards points and in addition there is a dragonfly that moves very fast but if it
                is caught by the frog then bonus points are rewarded. If the player loses all their lives, they can submit their score
                to the leaderboard and end the game or restart it. I used Python and the Pygame library to make this game, it was a very
                fun experience.</p>

                <p id = "mySecondProjectParagraph">This game utilizes JavaScript and the Phaser HTML5 game framework. This clone game titled "Azetude" is based on the 1972
                classic "Pong" but with an alien/UFO/outer space theme. This web app game supports keyboard arrow keys as directional movement and the mouse for clicking 
                on elements only (I may return to add paddle mouse and touch controls in the future). It is hosted via Heroku
                (cloud platform) as a web app.

                <p id="myThirdProjectParagraph">This application provides a directory from which the client can select customers,
                    appointments, or reports to view. In
                    addition, the app enables the client to add, modify, or delete any customers or appointments. There is extra
                    filtering
                    options to view appointments by current month or current week. The reports are divided into three different
                    reports, one
                    that shows appointments by any month or any type, one that shows the appointments of the trusted contacts, and a
                    final
                    one that shows how many customers the company has within divisions and countries. This application will allow
                    the
                    company to do all these operations efficiently and clearly and they can maintain their database of customers and
                    appointments without worry of losing any of it when the application closes. This project uses the following
                    application
                    technologies: JavaFX, IntelliJ, MySQL, Scene Builder.</p>

                <p id="myFourthProjectParagraph">This Jupyter Notebook application utilizes the popular K-Means cluster algorithm to generate fast and accurate game
                recommendations. It allows you to input a game you've played into a search bar on a custom user interface. Afterwards,
                it generates a column of several games which are the recommendations. Recommendations have matching game genres and fall
                in the same range of game ratings. Besides game recommendations, the K-Means algorithm is shown in a scatterplot
                visualization that includes the clusters of games taking into account the genre, rating, and year of release. In
                addition, the application also features a screen that displays a pie chart of how many games fall into each rating and a
                bar graph that details how many games belong to each genre. This project uses the following software languages/tools:
                Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas library, Matplotlib library.

                <h3 id="project5Heading">Package Delivery Routing App (based on Traveling Salesman Problem)</h3>
                <p id="myFifthProjectParagraph">In this project, I used object-oriented programming for many important entities such
                    as packages, trucks, and mailing
                    addresses. I created classes with objects to represent each of those entities (package, truck, mailingaddress).
                    I also
                    created a class for my chaining hash table data structure which would hold all package information. Next, I
                    created
                    several helper functions to read CSV file data for addresses, distances, and packages. Then, I created the core
                    functions which loaded the trucks with packages, found the distance between addresses, delivered each truck's
                    packages,
                    and calculated the minimum distance between addresses. Finally, I created and used a few functions that would
                    print the
                    information of a single package or all packages. A main menu was also included to allow the user to decide if
                    they want
                    to show the status of one package or all packages. All the status information would be printed through the few
                    functions
                    that are responsible for formatting the output to look neat and organized.

                <h3 id="project6Heading">Career Advisor Chatbot (AIML)</h3>
                <p id="mySixthProjectParagraph">The chatbot is a career advisor for computer science students. The human career
                    advisor has become too busy with the
                    increased enrollment of students and developed the chatbot to handle large quantities of students. The chatbot
                    will
                    interact with students to find the proper jobs that fit their strengths and preferences. The chatbot allows a
                    student to
                    type in their name and then the bot provides a varying number of questions to the student. The first question
                    includes
                    three choices, two of them contain follow-up questions and the last one doesn’t. All the questionnaire paths end
                    up
                    leading the students to one of five different computing jobs as their ideal job. The student is provided a link
                    to a
                    website that explains what the job entails.
                    I used the AIML language (that documentation was very useful, no seriously!) to do this project which is active
                    on the
                    pandorabots website. I had a lot of fun with this one. I will most likely create a new chatbot project in the
                    future and
                    implement it into my own website or integrate it with facebook or discord.
