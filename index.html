                            titled "Azetude" is based on the 1972
                            classic "Pong" but with an alien/UFO/outer space theme. This web app game supports keyboard arrow keys
                            as directional
                            movement and the mouse for clicking

                        <p class="description">This program is a game that plays like the popular game "Frogger" It involves the
                            player (a frog) having to cross
                            through several streets of traffic (cars) and some paths of grass. After surviving that, they have to
                            cross through a
                            river full of logs that are moving along the water. The frog can traverse using those logs and reach
                            several caves which
                            are the destination goals. Each cave rewards points and in addition there is a dragonfly that moves very
                            fast but if it
                            is caught by the frog then bonus points are rewarded. If the player loses all their lives, they can
                            submit their score
                            to the leaderboard and end the game or restart it. I used Python and the Pygame library to make this
                            game, it was a very
                            fun experience. Through Github, click on Code -> Download Zip then unzip the folder, open it in a Python IDLE and run the 'froggergamev2.py' file (make sure to have PyGame module installed in your IDLE beforehand).

                        <p class="description">This application provides a directory from which the client can select customers,
                            appointments, or reports to view. In
                            addition, the app enables the client to add, modify, or delete any customers or appointments. There is
                            extra
                            filtering
                            options to view appointments by current month or current week. The reports are divided into three
                            different
                            reports, one
                            that shows appointments by any month or any type, one that shows the appointments of the trusted
                            contacts, and a
                            final
                            one that shows how many customers the company has within divisions and countries. This application will
                            allow
                            the
                            company to do all these operations efficiently and clearly and they can maintain their database of
                            customers and
                            appointments without worry of losing any of it when the application closes. This project uses the
                            following
                            application

                        <p class="description">This Jupyter Notebook application utilizes the popular K-Means cluster algorithm to
                            generate fast and accurate game
                            recommendations. It allows you to input a game you've played into a search bar on a custom user
                            interface.
                            Afterwards,
                            it generates a column of several games which are the recommendations. Recommendations have matching game
                            genres and
                            fall
                            in the same range of game ratings. Besides game recommendations, the K-Means algorithm is shown in a
                            scatterplot
                            visualization that includes the clusters of games taking into account the genre, rating, and year of
                            release. In
                            addition, the application also features a screen that displays a pie chart of how many games fall into
                            each rating
                            and a
                            bar graph that details how many games belong to each genre. This project uses the following software
                            languages/tools:
                            Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas library, Matplotlib library. </p>

                        <p class="description">In this project, I used object-oriented programming for many important entities such
                            as packages, trucks, and mailing
                            addresses. I created classes with objects to represent each of those entities (package, truck,
                            mailingaddress).
                            I also
                            created a class for my chaining hash table data structure which would hold all package information.
                            Next, I
                            created
                            several helper functions to read CSV file data for addresses, distances, and packages. Then, I created
                            the core
                            functions which loaded the trucks with packages, found the distance between addresses, delivered each
                            truck's
                            packages,
                            and calculated the minimum distance between addresses. Finally, I created and used a few functions that
                            would
                            print the
                            information of a single package or all packages. A main menu was also included to allow the user to
                            decide if
                            they want
                            to show the status of one package or all packages. All the status information would be printed through
                            the few
                            functions
                            that are responsible for formatting the output to look neat and organized.</p>

                        <h3 class="h3ForProjects">Career Advisor Chatbot (AIML)</h3>
                        <p class="description">The chatbot is a career advisor for computer science students. The human career
                            advisor has become too busy with the
                            increased enrollment of students and developed the chatbot to handle large quantities of students. The
                            chatbot
                            will
                            interact with students to find the proper jobs that fit their strengths and preferences. The chatbot
                            allows a
                            student to
                            type in their name and then the bot provides a varying number of questions to the student. The first
                            question
                            includes
                            three choices, two of them contain follow-up questions and the last one doesn’t. All the questionnaire
                            paths end
                            up
                            leading the students to one of five different computing jobs as their ideal job. The student is provided
                            a link
                            to a
                            website that explains what the job entails.
                            I used the AIML language (that documentation was very useful, no seriously!) to do this project which is
                            active
                            on the
                            pandorabots website. I had a lot of fun with this one. I will most likely create a new chatbot project
                            in the
                            future and
                            implement it into my own website or integrate it with facebook or discord.</p>
