                <p id = "myFirstProjectParagraph">A program that simulates a pokemart in the command prompt using C++. 
                    It allows the user to set their in-game name, their amount of money at first. 
                    Next, the shopping music kicks in, and the program displays a menu that allows for buying items, 
                    checking the player bag for items they already have, and also quitting the program. When the user chooses to buy,
                     they are presented with a menu with several options from a file that I created. The program will notify them if 
                     they dont have enough money. After buying something, the user can buy another thing (assuming they have enough money),
                      or check their bag to see what they have already or just quit the program. This short project utilizes linked lists,
                       vectors, classes, and various methods to accomplish its tasks.</p>

                <p id = "mySecondProjectParagraph">This app acts like a MINI pokedex (showing water types, fire types, and anymore I choose to do). It uses standard views,
                images, labels, and a custom Pokemon class as well as passing data from view to view. The starting view presents
                different choices between pokemon types, a user clicks on one and that takes them to a new view which presents them with
                different Pokemon of that respective type. After a user clicks on one of the pokemon, a third view opens and this is the
                one that resembles the Pokedex, it shows a picture or gif of the Pokemon, their name, pokedex number and a description
                about them.</p>

                <p id = "myFourthProjectParagraph">This project is a small GUI app to be run in which it simulates a fictional bank desktop app. Initially, the app allows
                a user to create a basic bank account with their name, initial depositing amount, and bank account type. The user hits
                the submit button and the app takes the user to their account summary which has two buttons for withdrawing and
                depositing money. In addition, the scene displays customer name, balance, the date in which the account was made, and
                account type. When depositing, a new scene is shown that allows user to deposit any valid money amount and submit it
                with a button. There is also another button to go back to the main scene. When withdrawing, a new scene is shown that
                allows user to withdraw a valid money amount and submit it with a button. Withdrawing scene also includes a button to go
                back to the main scene.</p>
